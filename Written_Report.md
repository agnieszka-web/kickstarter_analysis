# Excel Analysis Kickstarter Campaigns 

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to find out how different campaigns in the Kickstarter dataset progressed according to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Outcome Analysis Graphs

### Outcomes based on Launch Date
For the analysis for the Theater outcomes based on launch date we can notice that the most successful months were May and June.  The slowest month for the campaign was December. There were 839 successful campaigns, 493 failed campaigns and 37 canceled campaigns, for a total of 1369 campaigns.

### Outcomes based on Goals 
The goal dollar amount ranges range from less then $1000 to more then $50000.
Highest range of money received was between $1000 and $4999 for the total of 388 received.
The second most successful amount was less the $1000 received.
for The highest contribution of over $50000 there were 2 successful campaigns.

The most failed goal amount range was the $1000 to $4999 range for the total of 146 failed campaigns.  
The greates amount of over $50000 there were 10 failed campaigns.  

### Difficulties
I found that there were not difficulties with this data set.  I could see a difficulty if there was no outcomes column.

### Graphs 
We could also create the Clustered Column chart or the Clustered Bar chart because there are only 3 outcomes: Successful, failed and canceled.  It would be easy to represent only 3 outcomes in a clustered column chart.
